##  Workflow

All development should be done in separate branches.  
Once a feature or fix is completed and tested, you can create a pull request to merge it into the `main` branch.

Recommended steps:

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
2. Make your changes.
3. Commit using the commit message format described below.
4. Push and open a pull request targeting `main`.
